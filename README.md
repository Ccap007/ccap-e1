- Official Project is a simple Java automation framework that I created  
   - im forced to use Eclipse for free Selenium
   - hamcrest and selenium dependencies added only
     - Right now the 2 classes each only open a browser session one chrome and one ff
     - I want to set the classes to run diff tests not browsers
    
    
* testFiles' .py files are for my own learning purposes sampling different things i watched videos on
   * hashMap stuff, hash tables are handy
   * lambda functions instead
   * BST traversals
   * after creating an Azure account/cloud server and a dotenv file, using their AI powered APIs to ID any photo
   * using python packages for ascii art, reading text aloud, simple Selenium WebDriver usage
