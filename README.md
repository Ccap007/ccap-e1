- Official Project is a simple Java automation framework that I created  
   - im forced to use Eclipse for free Selenium
   - hamcrest and selenium dependencies added only
     - Right now the 2 classes each only open a browser session one chrome and one ff
     - I want to set the classes to run diff tests not browsers
    
    
- testFiles' .py files are just for my own learning purposes, sampling different things
      - hash table
